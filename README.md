## UF DSA Project 2: US City Graphs

This is Project 2 for Data Structures and Algorithms at UF.
The project visualizes US cities as a graph, allowing users to find the shortest paths between cities using Dijkstra and A* algorithms.


## üöÄFeatures
- User selects a state, population range, number of cities, and neighbors per city.
- Graph visualization using [Bridges C++ API](http://bridgesuncc.github.io/).
- Calculates:
  - Shortest path distance (Dijkstra)
  - Shortest path distance (A*)

- Displays runtime and memory usage of both algorithms.


## üß∞ Prerequisites/Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have:

- VS Code with WSL Extension
  - Make sure it's installed on Windows
- Ubuntu (via WSL)
- g++ compiler with C++14 support
  - Check version with `g++ --version`
- Bridges C++ library installed
  - Follow the tutorial [here](https://bridgesuncc.github.io/), dowload [Linux] [TGZ] under C++ client

  
## ‚öôÔ∏èStep-By-Step Usage

1. In order to compile the project, you would need to setup and run BRIDGES Programs.
2. Follow the bridges setup tutorials: [BRIDGES:Getting Started](https://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges_setup.html)
3. Since this project is programmed in C++ by VS Code, you should follow the instruction here: [BRIDGES(C++) With VS Code:Getting Started](https://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges_setup_cxx_vscode.html)
4. Several things the user should be careful while going through the tutorial:
   - Make sure you have the WSL Extension installed in VS Code.
   - In your task.json file, make sure to change the compiler from clang++ to g++.
   - Follow the tutorial steps carefully to avoid path or linking issues (remember
   - "-I../bridges-cxx-LATEST-x86_64-linux-gnu/bridges-cxx-3.5.0-x86_64-linux-gnu/include" should be the relative path of include folder
   - "-L../bridges-cxx-LATEST-x86_64-linux-gnu/bridges-cxx-3.5.0-x86_64-linux-gnu/lib" should be the relative path of library folder
   - Remember you are editing the program in Ubuntu linux system, not your local Windows path.
5. Below is a example screenshot of what the project should look like:
6. Now compile it by using g++ command:

## üí°Input prompts:
- State abbreviation (case-insensitive, e.g., fl, Fl, FL)
- Minimum and maximum population
- Number of cities (1‚Äì500)
- Maximum neighboring cities per city (0‚Äì10)
- Start and end city for shortest path calculation
  - User can type the city name (case-insensitive)
  - Must exist in the selected state
