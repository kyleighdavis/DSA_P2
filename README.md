OK im gonna explain ...

## UF DSA Project 2: US City Graphs

1. This is our Proejct 2 for Data Strcutre and Algorithms 


## Features
- User selects a state, population range, number of cities, and neighbors per city.
- Graph visualization using [Bridges C++ API](http://bridgesuncc.github.io/).
- Calculates:
  - Shortest path distance (Dijkstra)
  - Shortest path distance (A*)

- Displays runtime and memory usage of the algorithm.
  
## Usage

1. In order to compile the project, you would need to setup and run BRIDGES Programs.
2. The instructions for C++/Java/Python is here: [BRIDGES:Getting Started](https://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges_setup.html)
3. Since this project is programmed in C++ by VS Code, you should follow the tutorial here:[BRIDGES(C++) With VS Code:Getting Started](https://bridgesuncc.github.io/bridges_setup_cxx_vscode.html)
4. Several things the user should be careful while going through the tutorial:
   -Make sure you have the WSL Extension installed in the VS code.
   -In yout task.json file, make sure to change the complier from clang++ to g++.
