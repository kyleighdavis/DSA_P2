1. This is our Proejct 2 for Data Strcutre and Algorithms 


## Features
- User selects a state, population range, number of cities, and neighbors per city.
- Graph visualization using [Bridges C++ API](http://bridgesuncc.github.io/).
- Calculates:
  - Shortest path distance (Dijkstra)
  - Shortest path distance (A*)
  - Straight-line distance between cities
- Displays runtime and memory usage of the algorithm.
